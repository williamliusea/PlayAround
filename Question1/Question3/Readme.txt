Q1 Find the path in 2 Dimensional array which has the most 1


You have a m*n size 2 Dimensional Array filled with either 0 or 1. You have to figure out the path which contains the most 1 when starting from arr[0][0]. You can only traverse down or right. 
For ex: If array has values

1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1

So here the path containing max 1 is arr[0][0], arr[0][1], arr[1][1], arr[1][2], arr[1][3] and arr[2][3]
